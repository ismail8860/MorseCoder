# Morse Coder (ESP32)
This device receives messages (upper-case English only) sent to it over the local network using a browser and codes them into Morse code that is then transmitted through light pulses from t>

## Hardware used:
ESP32-WROOM-32E
dupont wires
active piezo buzzer
LEDs (one external LED and one built-in LED(pin 2))

### Feedback :

The code needs improvement with readability and logic. 
replace values with named constants instead of reusing them.
